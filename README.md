# Portfolio
This is the portfolio of the work I've done so far in Rutgers Bootcamp.  Below you will find my three best projects. 

First is a movie search site, ['What Movie Was That?'](https://bthalpin.github.io/What-Movie-Was-That/), where you can search your favorite movies to get information and watch a trailer. The app was created by my team of highly skilled software developers.  It fetches data from OMDB API for accurate movie details, and YouTube API to allow the user to watch the movie trailers.

Next is a quiz app, ['Code Quiz'](https://bthalpin.github.io/Code-Quiz/). An app that randomly selects a number of questions that you have to answer before the time runs out.

Finally is the weather app, ['Weather Forecast'](https://bthalpin.github.io/Weather-Forecast/). A weather app that fetches data from Open Weather API and allows the user to get accurate up to date weather for any city in the world.

I hope you enjoy.  Feel free to contact me directly, or check out my GitHub repository and Linkedin pages by clicking the links in the contact section.
